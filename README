This repository contains the official, signed and scanned
Wright-Patterson AFB personnel records for Clerk-Stenographer JUNE MAXINE CRAIN
(1925–1998), aka JUNE MAXIME CUBBAGE, aka JUNE MAXINE KABA.

She worked as a civilian employee with a high security clearance for the War
Department — Army Air Corps at Wright Field between 1942–1952. They were
provided to me (Richard Geldreich, Jr.) by James E. Clarkson on 7/23/2022. 
The image files in this repository have not been modified in any way, and were copied straight into the git repository.

Her biography is in the book titled "TELL MY STORY - June Crain, the Air Force & UFOs" By James Clarkson:
